# MyDownloader
This is my project , developed for my Computer Networks subject. (2nd year Computer Science)

 It's mostly based on wget function and its parameters .
 
 MyDownloader allows the user to introduce an url , based on that link it can download the files attached to it 
 (the user can choose the depth level).
 
 It was developed in C++ , using QT - QCreator IDE.
 
 Steps:
 
 The user introduces a link -> several webpages which are present in the specific website are generated and shown in the application.
 Afterwards the user can choose from which webpage the download should begin.
 
 The directory where the files are saved is "hard-coded". (Website)
